# Offline Support Documentation

## Overview

SoloFitness implements a robust offline support system that allows users to continue using the application even when they don't have an internet connection. The system consists of three main components:

1. **OfflineService**: Manages offline operations and syncs them when back online
2. **SyncService**: Handles data synchronization with priority and conflict resolution
3. **CacheStrategy**: Provides local data caching for read operations

## OfflineService

The `OfflineService` is responsible for:
- Detecting online/offline status
- Storing operations while offline
- Syncing operations when back online
- Managing operation status (pending, synced, failed)

### Key Features
- Automatic detection of network status
- Persistent storage of offline operations
- Automatic sync when back online
- Operation retry mechanism
- Batch operation support

### Usage Example
```typescript
// Create an offline operation
const operationId = await offlineService.createOperation('update', '/exercises/123', data);

// Get pending operations
const pendingOps = offlineService.getPendingOperations();

// Get failed operations
const failedOps = offlineService.getFailedOperations();

// Clear all operations
offlineService.clearOperations();
```

## SyncService

The `SyncService` handles data synchronization with the following features:
- Priority-based queueing (high, normal, low)
- Conflict resolution strategies (overwrite, merge, skip)
- Batch operation support
- Progress tracking
- Automatic retry mechanism

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Critical operations (e.g., exercise updates)
- **Normal**: Regular operations (e.g., profile updates)
- **Low**: Non-critical operations (e.g., social posts)

### Conflict Resolution
- **Overwrite**: Replace existing data
- **Merge**: Combine with existing data
- **Skip**: Keep existing data

### Usage Example
```typescript
// Add a single operation to sync queue
await syncService.addToQueue('/exercises', 'POST', data, {
  priority: 'high',
  conflictResolution: 'overwrite'
});

// Add batch operations
await syncService.addBatch([
  {
    endpoint: '/exercises',
    method: 'POST',
    data: exercise1,
    priority: 'normal',
    conflictResolution: 'merge'
  },
  // ... more operations
]);

// Get sync progress
const progress = syncService.getProgress();

// Add progress listener
syncService.addProgressListener((progress) => {
  console.log(`Progress: ${progress.completed}/${progress.total}`);
});
```

## CacheStrategy

The `CacheStrategy` provides local data caching with:
- Configurable TTL (Time To Live)
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Memory and persistent storage options

### Usage Example
```typescript
// Get data with caching
const response = await cacheStrategy.withCache(
  '/exercises',
  () => apiService.getExercises(),
  undefined,
  5 * 60 * 1000 // 5 minutes TTL
);

// Invalidate cache
cacheStrategy.invalidate('/exercises');
```

## Implementation Details

### Offline Operation Flow
1. User performs an action while offline
2. Operation is stored in `OfflineService`
3. When back online, operations are synced via `SyncService`
4. Successfully synced operations are removed
5. Failed operations are retried or marked as failed

### Data Synchronization Flow
1. Operation is added to sync queue
2. Queue is processed based on priority
3. Each operation is executed with retry mechanism
4. Progress is tracked and reported
5. Cache is invalidated on successful sync

### Error Handling
- Network errors trigger retry mechanism
- Failed operations are stored for later retry
- Maximum retry attempts are configurable
- Failed operations can be manually retried

## Best Practices

1. **Operation Priority**
   - Use 'high' for critical data
   - Use 'normal' for regular updates
   - Use 'low' for non-critical operations

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Use 'overwrite' for new data
   - Use 'merge' for updates
   - Use 'skip' for optional updates

3. **Cache Management**
   - Set appropriate TTL based on data volatility
   - Invalidate cache when data is updated
   - Use memory cache for frequently accessed data

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling for failed operations
   - Provide user feedback for sync status
   - Allow manual retry of failed operations

## Limitations

1. **Storage Limits**
   - Local storage has size limitations
   - Large operations may need to be split

2. **Sync Performance**
   - Large batches may impact performance
   - Network conditions affect sync speed

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Complex conflicts may need manual resolution
   - Some data types may not support merging

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Conflict Resolution**
   - Add more sophisticated merge strategies
   - Implement version tracking
   - Add conflict visualization

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement operation compression
   - Add background sync
   - Optimize batch processing

3. **User Experience**
   - Add sync status indicators
   - Implement sync progress UI
   - Add manual sync controls
